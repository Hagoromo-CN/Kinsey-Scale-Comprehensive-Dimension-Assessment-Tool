## 📝 Tool Explanation
### What is Kinsey Scale?
The Kinsey Scale (1948) is a tool to measure sexual orientation, ranging from 0 (exclusively heterosexual) to 6 (exclusively homosexual), with X for asexuality.

### Our Scoring Logic
- **Core Orientation (0-6/X)**: Classic Kinsey Scale scoring
- **Social Stress (0-10)**: Social stress assessment based on responses
- **Asexuality Tendency (0-10)**: Supplementary scoring for asexuality tendency

⚠️ Note: This tool is for **self-awareness & fun only**, not a substitute for professional psychological diagnosis.
